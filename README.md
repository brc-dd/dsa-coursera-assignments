# Solved Assignments of Coursera's DSA Specialization

This repository contains the solved assignments of [Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms). Each solution is written in C++14.

Each of the file is tested to compile successfully on `g++ 7.4.0` with the flags as mentioned in the following command:

```bash
g++ -pipe -O2 -std=c++14 <filename> -lm
```

**Disclaimer:** If you are enrolled in any of the courses of this specialization, please strictly follow the [Coursera Honor Code](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209818863-Coursera-Honor-Code). The sole motive of publishing this repository publicly was to provide you with **some reference**. Please view the code **only** when you are really struck at a problem, and that too after performing [stress testing](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/algorithmic-toolbox/stress-test-implementation-Bskph).
